"# finish-knowledge-hub"
This project is created for Ukrainians living in Finland. The project includes categories with informative posts on
various aspects of life in Finland. For example, "All About Taxes", "All About Immigration Service", "All About Social
Services", "All About Labor Exchange". Here, all useful and necessary information is gathered in one place so that users
do not need to search for it from different sources.

Additionally, the project allows users to create their own posts by choosing from four categories. Users can leave
comments under each of the posts. There is also a section for advertisements where users can share or leave ads about
specific activities.

At the moment, the general search bar is not functional, but this issue will be addressed in the future. Currently, each
category has its own search bar implemented.

The project is planned to be developed further. Currently, the layout of all pages is planned to be designed to improve
the website's visual appearance.
